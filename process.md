# Problem solving process (Code challenge completion time 15 mins)

### Steps

1) I use ChatGPT to get a heuristic solution. I translate the problem in my own wording and hope to find a solution.

2) After testing the code samples from ChatGPT and the test cases were failed, I googled more solutions for solving this node-edge problem. However, those solutions lead me further away from solving the problem.

3) I return to ChatGPT and rephrase my wording. 

4) It reccomends me Dijkstra's Alogarithm. I have no prior knowledge about this alogarithm so I went on youtube to learn about it. 

5) Dijkstra's Alogarithm is about solving shortest path from one node to another. However, revisiting is not allowed. So, the method is not applicable to this problem.

6) I return to ChatGPT again. Instead of rephraesing my wording to the question, I copied and pasted the problem paragraph without providing input and output.

7) I want to provide a brief background to ChatGPT for it to get an idea what the question is about. Then I continue the chat with provided input and output. (It is a chatbot concept that learning from previous questions in order to give more accurate answer)

8) It returns me the code sample along with passing test cases. I double check the explanation from the ChatGPT and it aligns with what the problem asks.

9) I verfied whether the code sample can solve all the test cases by going to the website and modify the code according. (https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-visiting-all-nodes/)

10) It passes all the test cases. 

Remarks: Although it passes all the cases, I wish to test the code with more test cases since I don't know if the code actually solves the problem or it just solves only these 2 cases.
